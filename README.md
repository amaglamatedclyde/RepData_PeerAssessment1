## Introduction

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
device. The device collects data at 5 minute intervals throughout the
day. This data consists of two months of step counts from an anonymous
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012.

## Data

The dataset for this assignment was downloaded from the course web site:

* Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

* **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing
    values are coded as `NA`)

* **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD
    format

* **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which
    measurement was taken


## Assignment

In this assignment the step count observation data were analyzed and plotted using several methods. After   
imputing values for missing data, the analyses were repeated. An output html file was then created by knitr. 
All analyses and procedures are documented in the final html report file.
